# Cartoon-Coloring
Two instances of a cartoon are created and incorporated is a color swatch. The user is able to change the color of the head and/or body of the cartoon. This is done so by clicking on the color from the swatch and then clicking on the part of the cartoon you wish to change the color of, either the head or body. Another feature includes the user being able to drag the body of the cartoon without having the other parts of the body move with it. If the head is dragged everything, including the body, is moved the same distance (if the body was moved prior to this the body would still be detached, it will just move the same amount).
